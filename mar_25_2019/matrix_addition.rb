#Objective:
  # Create a final 2D array that sums the contents of the two arrays together

# Pseudocode:
  # iterate through only of the matrices ('a')
  # for each array in the matrix:
    # iterate through the inner array of 'a' (let's call it a matrix_row)
      # for each number in the array:
        # get the sum of the number in the matrix row of array 'a'
        # and the number of its equivalent index in array 'b'
        # push this result into an array called 'matrix_row'
    # once the iteration through an inner array of 'a' (matrix row) is finished:
    # push the matrix_row array into a final_array
  # output the final array
