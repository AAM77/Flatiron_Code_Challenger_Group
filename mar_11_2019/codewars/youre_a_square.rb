# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You
# especially like building blocks
# that are squares. And what you
# even like more, is to arrange
# them into a square of square
# building blocks!
#
# However, sometimes, you can't
# arrange them into a square.
# Instead, you end up with an
# ordinary rectangle! Those blasted
# things! If you just had a way to
# know, whether you're currently
# working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it!
# You just have to check if your
# number of building blocks is a
# perfect square.
#
# Task
# Given an integral number, determine
# if it's a square number:
#
# In mathematics, a square number or
# perfect square is an integer that
# is the square of an integer; in
# other words, it is the product of
# some integer with itself.
#
# The tests will always use some
# integral number, so don't worry
# about that in dynamic typed
# languages.

#
# take the sq_rt of x (or raise it to 1/2 power)
# assign this value to a variable (round to nearest integer)
# use modulo to see if there is a remainder when x is divided by the rounded
