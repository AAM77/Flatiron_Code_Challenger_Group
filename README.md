To Contributors:

This will provide us with experience collaborating on a project via GitHub. Here is a general overview of what GitHub is and how to use this repository.

## The Overview:

A repository is an online folder on GitHub.

A local repository is a folder on your machine.

When you commit something to a repository, you are attempting to make changes to the folder and  log those changes to the folder's history.

The best way to commit/add updates is to:

1. clone the repository
2. make changes to the repository on your machines
3. add & commit those changes to GitHub
4. push those changes up

## How to Use

1. Make the updates to a new branch. Include the date in its title.

2. Copy and paste the mon_date_year folder.

3. Edit its name and the folders/files it contains to reflect the challenges presented during that meeting.

4. Add .
5. commit -m "<a message with any notes you wish to make"
6. git push origin [branch_name]
