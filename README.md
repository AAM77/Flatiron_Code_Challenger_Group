# Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group

### Code Challenges from Flatiron Interview Prep Group

This will provide us with experience collaborating on a project via GitHub.

##PERMISSIONS:
Currently, only collaborators are allowed to make changes to this repo.

Collaborators, please see below for instructions.

## An Overview of How GitHub Works:

Please see the file: GitHub_Explanation.md on the main page of this repository.


The best way to commit/add updates is to:

1. clone the repository
2. create a new branch for the repository on your machines
2. make changes to the that branch
3. add & commit those changes to GitHub
4. push those changes up

Then, once the commits have been finalized and approved, they will get merged with the master branch.

## How to Use

1. Make the updates to a new branch. Include the date in its title.

2. Copy and paste the mon_date_year folder.

3. Edit its name and the folders/files it contains to reflect the challenges presented during that meeting.

4. Add .
5. commit -m "<a message with any notes you wish to make"
6. git push origin [branch_name]
