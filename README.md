# Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group

## Code Challenges from Flatiron Interview Prep Group

This repository is meant to:
1. Help keep track of the weekly sessions and code challenges.
2. Help familiarize new and existing members with the group and how the coding sessions work.
3. Provide a single location for members to access the group ReadMe, manual, various guidelines, weekly challenges, and various coding resources.

Please see below for more details: <br />
Collaborators may scroll to the bottom of the page (Permissions section) for a guide on how to collaborate.

## FOR THE NEW FOLKS:

Hi there and welcome!
<br />
<br />

### A Brief History of the Group
The idea for the group was originally posited by pcherian (Paul) in January 2019. Later, he, pmknyc (Paula), wendisha (Wendy), and aam77 (Adeel) unanimously decided to create the group on February 16, 2019 and became its founding members. All of us then worked together to schedule online and in-person sessions. We also established the group's guidelines (Agenda/ Manual) and created the GitHub repository while incorporating feedback from the group's existing and new members.
<br />
<br />
It has been quite the adventure so far and all of our members have benefited immensely from the sessions and the knowledge we share with one another about coding techniques and interview experiences. We hope to continue refining various aspects of the group and eventually benefit fellow Flatiron students as well as the larger coding community.
<br />
<br />

### Core Purpose
The group's core purpose is to help members become comfortable solving code challenges while successfully communicating code, analysis, and thought process during technical interviews. We accomplish this through mock technical interviews, where one person takes the hot seat to solve a challenge while the rest act as interviewers. Afterwards, we offer help and constructive feedback while fostering and maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for all of our members. We motivate and encourage each other to reach beyond our limits while remaining kind, courteous, understanding, mindful, and respectful towards one another.

### Second: Group & Session Guidelines
1. Inviting New Members
<br />
<br />
New members are more than welcome! But, there are some guidelines.
<br />
<br />
In the interest of scalability and maintaining a supportive atmosphere, membership is currently by invitation only.
<br />
<br />
Current members are welcome to invite fellow coders from Flatiron, but there are some preferred guidelines:
<br />
a. We (admins) prefer that you are somewhat familiar with the candidate. This is important to increase the likelihood that the person you are inviting is supportive and has an interest in learning, improving, and offering feedback.
<br />
b. Please make sure the candidates have read the group's agenda/ manual/  guidelines if they express interest. Send them a link to the repository and instruct them to read the ReadMe.
<br />
c. Please check with the group before inviting (especially the admins).
<br />
d. Once invited, please provide the proper introductions to help everyone get acquainted.
<br />
<br />

2. Session Guidelines
<br />
<br />
a. Please read the [Detailed Meeting Guidelines PDF](https://github.com/AAM77/Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group/blob/master/Group_Session_Guidelines_Detailed.pdf " Detailed Meeting Guidelines") file for a detailed explanation of meeting etiquette and expectations.

### Fourth: Resources
Please see the [Code Challenge Resources PDF ](https://github.com/AAM77/Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group/blob/master/Code_Challenge_Resources.pdf "Code Challenge Resources") file for resources to find code challenges and help. You can use other sources as well.
<br />
<br />

### Fifth: Participation (random selection)
Use the code in the [Choose Participant](https://github.com/AAM77/Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group/blob/master/choose_participant.js "Choose Participant") file to select a participant at random if no one volunteers.

1. On a mac, open a new tab in the Google Chrome browser.
2. Press Command-Option-J (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-J (Windows) to open the developer tools.<br />
3. Click on the 'console' tab of the developer tools.<br />
4. Copy & Paste the code from the [Choose Participant](https://github.com/AAM77/Flatiron_Code_Challenger_Group/blob/master/choose_participant.js "Choose Participant") JS file into the console.<br />
5. Fill in the participants array with the names (or abbreviations) of the eligible number of participants.<br />
6. Hit enter to see who goes.<br />
7. You can make things a bit more fun by having the participant do this at the end of her/his turn.
